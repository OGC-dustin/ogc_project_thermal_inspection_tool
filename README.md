Purpose:
- Development platform for image capture ( RGB and Thermal ) use in various inspection tasks

Use cases:
- Identification of thermal hot spots
- Aggregate distance measurement to landmark
- Color reflection analysis ( including IR light source )

This project is also acting as a demonstration project illustrating layered development for speed and maintainability.
